# 2023-SP-6604-HW4

Implement partial path replication scheme for indexing.

First, generate an indexing tree and then define the replication level in the tree and then generate the index schedule where index can be repeated at the level selected.  

Output: Show the index structure, and given a clientâ€™s tune in location, and show the search sequence for locating a data item. The implementation should be generic; it should take input from the user.
